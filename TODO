1.Add static website, using git clone
a. make sure git is installed
	name: install git
	package: name=git
b. clone website repo and copy to webserver directory
	name: deploy website
	git: repo=https://github.com.........git
	dest=/usr....www.var?..../html?
2. Play with enabling docker bit, and each tool one at a time until the pi 3 is 100% CPU (network stats might be limited by pi NIC - rather than the actuall internet speed).
3. Move the internet stuff to a newer pi (e.g. Pi4), keeping the static website on the pi 3, so it can defintely be enabled.
